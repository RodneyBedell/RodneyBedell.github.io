            <h2>Meet Rodney</h2>
            <p>This is your quick elevator pitch to explain to people that visit your website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Who</b> you are.</li>
                <li><b>Where</b> you live.</li>
                <li><b>What</b> you do.</li>
                <li>And what makes you <b>special</b>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Having a nice photograph of you at the top of this page will certainly help personalize this website and give new people a better sense of who you are.</p>

            <h2>About Rodney</h2>

            <p>Your About section is your chance to explain in greater detail who you are and why someone should hire you. Take the time to explain more about you in greater detail than you would in your introduction. The key here is balance: having enough content to engage the reader, yet not too much where you'll lose their attention span. Have I lost yours yet? :)</p>

            <p>Things that can be useful here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>List of <b>Programming Languages</b> you know (and how well you know them).</li>
                <li><b>Education</b> or certificates.</li>
                <li><b>Hobbies</b> that are appropriate to share.</li>
                <li>Links to relevant <b>social media</b> profiles.</li>
                <li><b>Testimonial</b> (kind words others would say about you.</li>
                <li>Anything else unique about you?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is important that you know yourself well enough so you can explain to others how you can help them. Being able to assure potential clients and employers that you understand them and their needs is key. Sometimes you'll want to make sure the world knows that you are willing to take on any size project, nothing is too large or too small. Or maybe you found a nitch and you want to tailor your limited resources to a spectific market. The more clear you are, the more comfortable your potential clients will be in contacting you.</p>

            <h2>Rodney's Work</h2>

            <p>I wrote a small program to create a numbered list of raffle spots, and fill it with the name of the person who claimed each spot.
