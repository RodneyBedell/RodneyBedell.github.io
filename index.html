            <h2>Meet Rodney</h2>
            <p>I'm a software engineering student in the North Shore Boston area with a passion for clean user experiences that are inclusive and accessible to all.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I'm interested in designing user experiences that work smoothly and don't accidentally exclude potential users, and I'm interested in working with other great programmers who want to do the same.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on a project or learning a new skill, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and playing card games.</p>

            <p>I've worked with a handful of Programming Languages, and might be able to help you with your projects if they involve one of the following: (in appoximate order of expertise)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I'm working my way through the FreeCodeCamp web design course right now, and I should be capable of a lot more very soon!</p>

            	<li>
            		I wrote a small program in Java to create a numbered list of raffle spots, and fill it with the names of the people who claimed each spot. You can check out the source code for

            <p>I can help you set up a website for your business, brand, or blog.</p>
